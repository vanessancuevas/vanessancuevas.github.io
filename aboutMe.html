            <h2>{ Designing to improve the human experience }</h2>
             <p>     
                  A Bay Area native, I studied for a degree in <strong>Psychology (B.S.)</strong> before deciding upon my current major, <strong>Design: Visual Communications (B.S.) at San Francisco State University</strong>. As I entered the world of design, I began to notice our current design ethics are grouonded in "user-centered" designs rather than "human-centered" designs. 
        </p>
        <p> 
            
        I took the foundation I had in psychology and began to apply it to my research and design process.  Ultimately, my goal is to <strong> humanize and evolve the visual language</strong> of the products we use everyday.

    <p> I <strong> hike regularly</strong> in the redwoods, <strong>roller-skate</strong> around my neighborhood, <strong> snowboard</strong> occasionally, and am obsessed with <strong>food and wine pairings</strong>. Food is a daily ritual we often take for granted. I believe every meal is an experience. It is an opportunity to ground yourself in the present moment through all five senses. This is why I love to cook and explore food & beverages with my friends and family. </p> 
    <p> More than anything, <strong>I love coffee</strong>. Coffee is a part of my daily ritual and a family tradition after every meal. I order green coffee beans from countries all over the world and take the time to roast them myself. 
    </p>
    <p> 
        I also <strong> enjoy readings</strong> such as <em> The Art of Thinking Clearly</em>  by Rolf Dobelli, as well as <em> Minds, Brains, Computers: An Historical Introduction to the Foundations of Cognitive Science</em> by Robert Harnish.
