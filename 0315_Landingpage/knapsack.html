    <h3>No, you don’t have to upload your whole house into lists</h3>

<br>    
    <li>Save your lists and Knapsack will remind you what you pack for similar destinations and trips.

    Over time, Knapsack will recommend destinations to travel based on your items, activities, and companionships.  </li>

        We have different needs at different times of the year.
    </h3>
    <p>As users search for destinations, a photo of the destination in its current season gives the user a sense of the weather conditions.
    Seasonal recommendations are offered based on average annual weather conditions (future feature: user reported tips).
    <p>
    Compare how many of your Companions have also traveled to the same destinations
</p>
<p>
     Our Calendars feature allows you to sync iCal or Google Calendar to find recommended destinations based on your location and the time of year. 
    </p>
    <p>
     Alter your priorities ($$$, distance from home, activities offered) to adjust your recommendations at any time.

        Search, share, and chat in one app
    </h3>
    <p>
        Share destinations, create lists, and vote on group decisions all in one place without switching from app to app.        
    </p>
<p>

    Getting everyone to agree is hard. That’s why we implemented group votes and item requests to help users make these decisions quickly.

    Want to go your separate ways on a trip?

       <p>
        Share your location in the chat so your companions can see the relative distance you are from them.

    <h3>Honorable Mentions</h3>
   <p> I love to collaborate, however, this case study was done independently. 
</p>
<p>
    Custom logo and vector illustrations were made in Adobe Illustrator. 
</p>
<p> 
    In addition to this case study, a full design brief is available.
